Events <--- React


. You didn't close a deal with a customer

. Your teenager got in trouble at school

. You didn't finish your to-do list today

"What patterns underlie the things I am experiencing?"

React ---> Predict

* Getting Below the Surface
---------------------------
. Is this a single instance of a pattern?

. Is this an emerging patter or behavior?

. Is this a one-off event?

	You didn't close a deal with a customer				Product sales are declining over time
	---------------------------------------				-------------------------------------


	Your teenager got in trouble at school				Uptick in outbursts and behavior issues
	--------------------------------------				---------------------------------------

	
	You didn't finish your to-do list				Not finishing tasks is habitual
	---------------------------------				-------------------------------


Seeing mental models reframes how we think, design, predice, and react.

	    Events <------------ React
   System patterns ------------> Predict
 System structures ------------> Design
     Mental Models ------------> Reframe
